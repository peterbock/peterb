<h2>The Full Tilt Boogie</h2>

<p>I was in a wheelchair with bike pedals<br />
others were in motorized chairs<br />
laughing at me or hurling insults.</p>

<p>We raced past Disneyland in Anaheim<br />
into a huge 8 story blue marble building<br />
chock full of people with missing or<br />
malfunctioning deformed limbs.</p>

<p>I went as fast as I could through all<br />
the floors, all the very large expansive rooms filled<br />
with all races of people<br />
receiving all kinds of help<br />
"Patients" outnumbered the "help" by 1,000:1<br />
There were hundreds of thousands of people crammed everywhere in this building.</p>

<p>An armless Indian girl slipped off an operating table<br />
into my arms and smiled as she slid<br />
out of my lap onto the floor to squirm.</p>

<p>An African woman also without arms, missing half a leg<br />
had a really cool shoe on her one useless foot with a key in the midsole<br />
I put the key in deeper and turned it<br />
she tilted her head and eyes and said "Thank you!"</p>

<p>By now my wheelchair was gone<br />
I was jogging through the floors<br />
Touching and hugging thousands<br />
of "damaged" people<br />
I could feel the energy go right out of me<br />
and then I'd feel it fill me up<br />
proportionate to the degree of need of the next person<br />
I randomly encountered.</p>

<p>Each floor, each time through as fast as I could manage<br />
touching, hugging, grasping, touching<br />
The energy released and filled again effortlessly<br />
until after scores of times<br />
through it became<br />
filled with joyous, ecstatic people.</p>

<p>It was the Full Tilt Boogie.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thoughts upon waking: I embodied Hafiz, Jesus, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zachariah" target="_blank">Zachariah Kral</a>. This should be no surprise to people who know Zach's penchant for dancing. A Full Tilt Boogie is a mass of people who wake up to their divinity which transcends their physical forms. The only response to this awakening is to dance, dance, dance!</p>

<p>Greater works are we to do. Jesus raised the dead, cured the lame, healed people left and right. Greater works are we to do just because. It's not a matter of "have you achieved that level of faith to do greater works?" No. It's a matter of will you just start assuming that greater works is the norm? Will you start shedding the weight of errant thinking that weighs you down from ever walking on water with grace? People need YOU!</p>

<p>Yes, YOU! Your flaws don't matter a nano-iota in the grand realm of this eternal moment. Do not judge your Self anymore. Do not question why God made you this way or that. Just be you, unfettered from negative false thinking, free of the illusions that seduce you, take you off the straight and narrow that leads to a full vibrant life without restrictions.</p>

<p>The Full Tilt Boogie in other words</p>

</div>

				
				<div class="tab-pane" id="aim">
				<h2>Ready, Aim, Love</h2>

				<p>We're all in this together. No man is an island. No man or woman is separate from others. As one person suffers, we all suffer whether we can perceive this or not, whether we feel it with our bodies or have shut it down.</p>

				<p>Elevating the individual above the common diminishes that individual and the common, and vice versa. It's important to recognize the individual attributes that are given, to acknowledge the effort, energy and time put into what the individual have given to make the common a better place.</p>

				<p>Those who advocate weapons or the use of weapons do not have their own interests nor the fellow humans' best interest at heart. Since my friend will not answer my questions about how one can reconcile being "open to life" and yet advocate the use of weapons, I have to conclude that at a minimum he can't answer the questions.</p>

				<p>History has shown that there is no shortage of people who will defend the indefensible. Those who advocate the use of weapons tend to die by the use of weapons, and tend to deceive themselves and others that the right to bear arms was meant to defend themselves against their neighbors.</p>

				<p>The conceit and deceit lies in the overarching fantasy that with weapons we can confront and rid the commons of violent people. But history has shown that violence begets violence begets violence. We reap what we sow: if you're willing tom put bullets into another body, how can you escape bullets being put into your own?</p>

				<p>We each choose to pick up a gun and aim it at what we perceive to be our problem, or we make love our aim. Love is not a feeling. Love is the recognition that we are in this together. Love is the willingness to hold other people accountable to make this world a better place. Love does not use a weapon when there are disagreements. Love doesn't shut down communications. Love is open to debate and is willing to reach a consensus that is best for everyone.</p>

				<p>Some call this socialism, others call it communism. I call it community.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="tab-pane" id="belief">
				<h2>Power of Belief</h2>

				<p>Never underestimate the power of belief. It doesn't matter if you believe rightly or wrongly, believe in heaven and/or hell. What matters is you believe - your thoughts and actions always follow your beliefs.</p>

				<p>This issue becomes acute when you're attempting to change any aspect of your life. In order to change you need to accurately identify the limiting belief that no longer serves you.</p>

				<p>Ego is the repository of your belief system. Your mind, how you think. What you say reflects what you believe. These reinforce your belief system.</p>

				<p>The political arena is a titanic clash of 3 powerful belief systems. Obama believes in your innate goodness. Romney believe in money. And the propaganda machine known as "the media" believes in omission of details so as to always give itself wiggle room under the cover of "objectivity".</p>

				<p>The media exploits your belief system, which is primarily a conservative point of view. 80% of all content is written by PR firms. I assume the other 20% is written by sports journalists because it doesn't require much specialization. It's all opinion anyways save for "reporting" on scores which is what computers do automatically.</p>

				<p>Into this virtual world explodes belief systems. If you're watching ANY amount of TV you're allowing your belief systems and consequential thoughts to be manipulated by corporations.</p>

				<p>That's not my belief by the way. That's my experience because I do not watch TV. I dare you to try it: unplug your TV and put it in a closet for 1 month. Or stick it in the garage.</p>

				<p>Then get busy doing all the things you want to do. Read books. Learn to cook new vegetarian recipes. Spent 30 minutes doing yoga for exercise. Reboot into a new you.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="tab-pane" id="millenials">
				<h2>Millenials</h2>

				<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/02/adulthood-delayed-what-has-the-recession-done-to-millennials/252913/" target="_blank">Millenials: A Generation Delayed</a></p>

				<p>Millenials graduated from an educational system that needs to reboot itself for contraction. The contraction will happen whether we want it to or not. The use of pesticides will contract because they're not sustainable. Farmers are right to be skeptical of new/old herbicides - they know they're going to run into resistance issues - again.</p>

				<p>Likewise the Consumer society of the past 50+ years is contracting. It has a very tenuous hold on Millenials. If they would just ditch their TVs I believe they can reinvent society to focus on the most needful things, such as.... food, a human's numero uno need.</p>

				<ul class="unstyled">
					<li>Got shelter? Check</li>
					<li>Got clothing? Check</li>
					<li>Got food to go with shelter and clothing? If not, then it cancels out the need for shelter and clothing.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>The Farm Bill needs to phase out subsidies to methods that don't work. While it's unfortunate that chemical farmers have become dependent on Federal subsidies via the Farm Bill, the sooner we subsidize organic farming, the better off we'll be.</p>

				<p>And we'll <strong>have</strong> to start transitioning to organic anyways because the #ChemAg "revolution" started in 1971 has crippled the environment and compromised planetary health.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="tab-pane" id="inequal">
				<h2>Inequal Outcomes: The Paul Ryan YOYO Gospel</h2>

				<p>Paul Ryan: <em>"We promise equal opportunity, not equal outcomes."</em></p>

				<p>Spoken like the brazen thief that he is. Are you one of the 1%? Or do you just believe that someday you will be. I can tell you right now that that day is NEVER coming. The greatest among you will be the least. And the least among you shall be the greatest.</p>

				<p>With state budgets recovering from the greatest heist in the history of humanity around the year 2060 when I'll be 100 years old, tell me your rationale for supporting these 2 thieves. I PAID into Social Security, and I don't know, maybe you did too for awhile. I worked for that money that I paid into Social Security and yet some of my classmates from high school have forgotten your roots. When my retirement winds up in the pocket of Paul Ryan and his friends I sure as hell hope that you have enough money saved up to support those who got screwed. Remember: As you've done it to the least of them, so you've done it to God.</p>

				<p>And who are the least of them? Those whom society rejects. If you're really a Christian, go sell all you have and give the proceeds to those who have much less than you. If you love Christ as you profess, then go lay down your life for a friend, better yet, lay it down for someone you don't even know instead of clinging to your ri.dic.u.lous dogma that guarantees on judgment day that your lamp has no oil.</p>

				<p>Walk the talk. Every day with every thought and every thought. Live. Do it. Love those you don't even like because you sure as hell don't know their situation. If you did you wouldn't judge them as unworthy. And remember this definition of policy: a codified way of dealing with people and situations. Those who "like" Ryan and Romney most definitely do not have anyone's interest in their heart.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="tab-pane" id="legalism">
				<h2>Legalism Is Regressive</h2>

				<p><em>Render to Caesar what belongs to Caesar; render to God what belongs to God.</em> Political/legal/religious solutions are anything but. There's always someone trying to find a way out from whatever they feel like isn't fair to them. Spiritual materialism thinks God has blessed them because of their thinking, or beliefs, and never their actions.</p>

				<p><em>You shall know them by their fruits.</em> But most people today vote based on what someone says, not on their fruits. I say all the right things but my walk fails to match my words, and you'll just chalk it up to being human. I suffer no consequence. Emboldened by your so-called 'turning the other cheek' I widen the scope of my malfeasance which gains me more money. You'll forgive me because that's what Christ compels you to do.</p>

				<p>Because I'm getting away with my malfeasance which harms you, I continue to exploit your beliefs for my own personal gain, and in the core of my essence I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing and you whom I'm exploiting are deaf, dumb, blind and born to follow. You're so willing to believe that I follow after God's heart - after all God is blessing me by allowing my thievery to continue unabated, without consequence, without a hint of justice in these lawless times - that you'll rationalize away any hint of variation to being human. You'll never figure it out just because I say so.</p>

				<p>Make no mistake: everyone, absolutely everyone on this planet is currently engaged in one of two types of behavior: giving or stealing. From that derives all other kinds of positive or negative behavior. Where to draw the line?</p>

				<p>The above describes legalism which is adherence to the letter of the law. Legalism can quickly become legislated lawlessness, which is exactly the social and political environment we find ourselves in today.</p>

				<p>What of the <em><strong>spirit</strong></em> of the law? You know, <em><strong>love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control; against such there are no restrictions.</strong></em> No belief system required. No attendance at church required. No prayer, no subscriptions, no requirements whatsoever will prevent you from manifesting the fruits of the spirit.</p>

				<p>Do you see the contrast now between the 10 commandments and the 9 fruits of the spirit? All law (legalism) has "no" (restrictions) at its core. The fruits of the spirit have none. They are all "yes" and positive to both you and your neighbors.</p>

				<p>All law is based on the past, not today. All love can happen only in this moment. Only this moment is available for you to leave the restrictions of legalism and choose love.</p>

				<p>This is why it's written "Love your neighbor as yourself". Not your fellow church-goer, but that asshole next door. Jesus in all of his distressing disguises.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="tab-pane" id="greater">
				<h2>Love: how you treat those outside your circle/class</h2>

				<p><em>There is no greater love than this: that a man should lay down his life for his friends. (John 16:13)</em></p>

				<p><em>As you have done it to the least of these, you've done it also to me. (Matt. 25:40)</em></p>

				<p>These words were spoken not to believers, but to the very first followers of Jesus. Like us, they struggled to understand what love was. Jesus makes it clear: whatever you do to others you are doing to him. This is unconditional love.</p>

				<p>There are no preconditions required to love someone. They need not be a believer, go to church, practice the same brand of religion, nor speak the same language as you. They only requirement is no requirements whatsoever.</p>

				<p>How then is it that the love of many has grown cold? How come many have allowed themselves to be blinded by the rigid dogmas of their ignorance and hate? How come anyone would allow themselves to be manipulated by money when Jesus was clear: you cannot serve God and mammon (money)?</p>

				<p>Yet here we are. People fervently support a wealthy man who needs no additional money. They "believe" in him for no other reason than they too serve money. Jesus said "render to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and render to God what belongs to God" and yet they give this man their money.</p>

				<p>Jesus said keep 1 coat, 1 pair of sandals. Keep it light. Don't go heavy in materialism because it will weigh you down. Keep it simple. How many of you have things? How many of those things actually own you?</p>

				<p>You can't take it with you, so why not liberate yourself of them now? Give them to someone in need.</p>
